# Linear-Algebra-Solutions-to-the-Compendium-
This as all my handwritten solutions to the exceries to the compendium "Problemsamling i Linjär Algebra för Statistik och dataanalysprogrammet kurs 732G01". However, this was not **for the course 764G01*** but rather **765G08.** Sadly in 2025, our program decided that they were to move the Linear Algebra course from the divison of Mathematics to the divison of Computer Science. This was due to the bad performance of the students in the course. If this compendium is still used in the new course, I don't know. However, I am happy to share this with whomever it may help. The new course is called **Grundläggande matematik, linjär algebra och logik för statistiker (764G09)**.
